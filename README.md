## Introduction

In Machine Learning, regression analysis is the statistical tool that is used to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables. There are two commonly used techniques that are  designed for distinct kinds of prediction tasks those two are the Linear regression and the Logistics Regression. Predicting the continuous dependent variable from one or more independent variables is called linear regression. In contrast, the method used for classification tasks with a categorial dependent variable is the Logistic Regression.
