## Introduction

In Machine Learning, regression analysis is the statistical tool that is used to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables. There are two commonly used techniques that are  designed for distinct kinds of prediction tasks those two are the Linear regression and the Logistics Regression. Predicting the continuous dependent variable from one or more independent variables is called linear regression. This method is very useful when it comes to predicting prices with the use of metrics like Mean sq. d Error (MSE) and R-squared.  In contrast, the method used for classification tasks with a categorial dependent variable is the Logistic Regression. This method is very effective with the use of classification metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.

In this project there are two dataset that will be used which are the Car Price Prediction for Linear Regression and Customer Satisfaction for Logistic Regression. The Car Price Prediction Dataset contains various features related to automobiles, such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and other specifications that influence the selling price of a car. The Customer Satisfaction will focus on the feedback of the customers to predict if they are satisfied or dissatisfied. This includes the demographic profile of the customers and the service rating as well as the purchase frequency. This will serve as a predictor for the target variable. With that, logistic regression will be utilized to classify customers into two categories based on their satisfaction level.
